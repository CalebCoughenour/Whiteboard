write an algorithm that removes duplicates from an array
do not use functions like "filter()"
after solving demonstrate the use of "filter()"

1. write a function that takes in array
2. loop through array (i) for length of array
3. add second loop that will compare (j) to (i) and also making sure array[i] != array[j]
4. if they are equal, and not the same position, remove from array
5. if not equal, move to next element
6. return altered array, removed duplicates
